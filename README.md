#SSOPress - v0.2.0
SSOPress is a single sign-on plugin for Wordpress. It currently operates via JWT based authentication.

##Installation
Just download and jam in your plugins directory. The configuration menu is under Settings > Single Sign-on.

##Configuration
Configuration is simple. Just provide your SSO provider's Login URL, Logout URL, and JWT Secret.

You can also enable or disable requiring your users to use sso, obfuscating passwords when logging in to extra-prevent traditional login, and wether or not users that don't exist should be provisioned.

##JWT Claim Specs
Almost every user attribute is supported in the JWT claim. Some attributes will be auto generated by the other attributes that are available if they are not present in the claim.

`username` and `email` must be present in the claim.

If `role` is not set, it will default to `subscriber`.

Usernames and email addresses are unique among users. When auto provisioning users the process will fail if either value is taken.
